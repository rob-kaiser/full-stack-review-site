				"Delicious as usual! Never a disappointment. I read the menu every time and every time I get the same thing because it is so amazing. The drink-a fleur de lis. The appetizer-deviled eggs. The salad-Is a Alex but it's the dressing that makes it a standout, champagne vinaigrette. The main-Filet, it just melts. I take home half my dinner just so I can have dessert-Carrot cake and French press coffee. If you have never been here make a reservation pronto. There is quite a variety to pick from. Sushi sandwiches, even chicken tenders. It is always a nice evening out. My husbands favorite part is the cold bottle of water they bring to the table. He smiles every time they set it down.",

The salads were large and fresh and the bread was still warm. My problem is a new sign saying no firearms allowed. If this is a store by store decision, I guess I will have to find a new favorite restaurant.",

They walk you through the kitchen before seating, I recommend picking one entree for two because the portions are HUGE there is no way that you can have a 3 course meal with these portions.
